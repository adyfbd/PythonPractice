# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating object
# Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object. Every Object has
a different address in heap memory
# Constructor allocates size to the object

# Class has attributes as (Variables) and behaviour as methods(Functions)

self

The word 'self' is used to represent the instance of a class. By using the "self" we access the attributes and
methods of the class in python.
__init__ method

"__init__" is a reserved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology.
This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of
the class.

@classmethod and @statiscmethod

classmethod -  , you can use this and attributes inside the __init__ method without creating an object of the class

staticmethod - you dont need anything like 'cls' as class method you can use it directly

PRIVATE variables or methods, use self._car=car >>> use underscore so no one changes it
