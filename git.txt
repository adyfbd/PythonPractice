Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

GitHub commands:
1. Install Git
2. Create a repository (project Folder name)
3. git clone https://github.com/adyfbd/PythonPractice.git "To fetch the repository from github"
4. git status to track the files
5. git add ''filename'' and then again git status to check status or use "add ." to add all files
6. git commit -m ("commit and lock the changes")
6. git push "to push files to repository"
7. git pull ""to pull the changes""

3. git checkout "branch name" (To switch to the branch)
